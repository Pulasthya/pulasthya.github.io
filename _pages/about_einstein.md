at the [University at Buffalo, SUNY](https://www.buffalo.edu/).

I am a software engineer with a strong passion for solving complex problems, optimizing data pipelines, and building efficient, scalable systems. Beyond my professional work, I enjoy exploring nature through trekking, challenging myself with long-distance running, and immersing myself in the world of cars and Formula 1. Whether I am debugging code or analyzing race strategies, I am always striving for excellence and continuous improvement.
